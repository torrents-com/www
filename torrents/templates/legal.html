<h2>terms of use</h2>
<p>This agreement regulates access to and use of the {{ g.domain }} website that Torrent Software, S.L. (hereinafter THE COMPANY) provides users interested in the service. Use of the services provided on this website implies the user's acceptance of these terms of use. THE COMPANY may, at any time and without prior notification, stop rendering its services through {{ g.domain }} and may modify the service rendered, whether this be to accidental or significant aspects. THE COMPANY does not guarantee that the service provided through Torrents will be uninterrupted or without error.</p>
<p>Use of this service by the users is completely free.</p>
<p>{{ g.domain_capitalized }} provides a torrent search service that automatically generates results. This website does not reproduce, distribute, publicly announce or transform any intellectual property. The results generated by the users’ searches only show the links to torrents or pages that meet the search criteria entered and are not hosted on this website. The user is aware that THE COMPANY does not assume any obligation to control, supervise or inspect the files or pages that are linked as search results. Nevertheless, in strict compliance with article 17 LSSI, {{ g.domain_capitalized }} shall remove all of those results that it actually knows to be illegal. THE COMPANY is not responsible for the reliability or security of the files that appear linked as search results, nor is it responsible for ensuring that they are free from virus. It is up to the user to protect their system with the necessary security measures.</p>
<p>THE USER can inform THE COMPANY of the existence of any file linked from Torrents that they know to be illegal, or of which they have well-founded suspicions. THE USER who informs THE COMPANY of the existence of pages or files that are presumably illegal or disseminated without the appropriate authorisation, should exclusively use the contact form provided for this purpose by THE COMPANY and shall accurately provide the information required therein. Prior to this, the user should read and accept THE COMPANY’s privacy policy. THE COMPANY reserves the right to remove links to files or pages it knows to be illegal or of which it has well-founded suspicions. THE COMPANY also reserves the right to use all technological measures that it avails of in order to remove search results which link to content that could be illegal or disseminated without the mandatory authorisation. Nevertheless, the user recognises that the full effectiveness of these measures in always serving their purpose, cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to submit this agreement to Spanish law and jurisdiction, and specifically to the Courts of Madrid (Spain).</p>
<p>THE COMPANY may modify these terms of use. The users should refer to these terms of use frequently to be aware of possible changes made since the last time they accessed the website. Use of the service after changes have been made to the terms of use implies that the user is aware of and accepts the new modified version of said terms.</p>
